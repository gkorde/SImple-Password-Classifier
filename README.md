# SImple-Password-Classifier

A program in python to parse a password database and output certain patterns. The program has been written for the coursework of UB CSE 664. The password database is a 3GB file that contains passwords of varying lengths and characters, and with repetitions. 
The first problem in the code will output the most repeated passwords in the file.
The second problem will output the probability of a character appearing in the file, considering repetitions.
The third problem will output the probability of a character appearing in the file, considering only unique characters(non repetitive).
The fourth problem will cross check the entire file with four known SHA1 hashes and output the corresponding passwords.
